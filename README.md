# Yet Another Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python

## How to Play

1. Players take turns entering their moves.
2. The game ends when one player wins by having three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or when all spaces on the board are filled without a winner, resulting in a draw

## Features

- Supports two players, with symbols 'X' and 'O'
- Clears the screen after each move for better visibility
- Validates user input to ensure it corresponds to a valid move on the board
- Checks for a winner after each move

## How to Run

0. Ensure you have Python installed on your system
1. Clone this repository or download the `main.py` file
3. Run the script using `python main.py`
